In this project, a real-time digital oscilloscope system based on
FPGA has been designed. Oscilloscopes, which play a significant
role in various industries such as science, engineering, and
biomedical fields, are used to visualize voltage changes as a
function of time. Similarly, this system has been developed to
perform tasks such as debugging and signal analysis. Behind its
simple interface and user-friendly operation with different
modes lies the collaboration between the FPGA and Raspberry
Pi, enabling high-speed data transfer and processing for accurate
measurement and analysis.In project AD9226 ADC module, Spartan-6 XC6SLX16 FPGA board,
Raspberry Pi 3A+, LCD screen, and its interface module were
used. The Spartan-6 FPGA was implemented using VHDL, while
data analysis and display interface were implemented on the
Raspberry Pi using the Python programming language.You can directly access VHDL part through "Digital Oscilloscope.zip" folder.
